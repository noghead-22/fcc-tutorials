/**
 * Functional Programming is a style of programming where solutions are
 * simple, isolated functions, without any side effects outside of the function scope:
 * INPUT -> PROCESS -> OUTPUT
 * 
 * 
 * functional programming is about :
 * 1.isolated functions - there is no dependence on the state of the program,
 * which includes global variables that are subject to change
 * 2.pure functions - the same input always gives the same output
 * 3. functions with limited side effects - any changes, or mutations, to the state
 * of the program outside the function are carefully controlled.
